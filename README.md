Endodontic Treatment of Upper Second Molar
Radiographic Evaluation:
üì∏ Image 1 ‚Äì Pre-operative radiograph:
Tooth: Upper second molar.

Condition:

The pulp chamber appears radiolucent, indicating necrosis or irreversible pulpitis.

There may be signs of periapical radiolucency (indicative of apical periodontitis or an abscess), particularly around the mesio-buccal root.

Curvature of roots and possible narrowing of canals, especially in the mesiobuccal root, which may suggest MB2 presence.

Bone loss and widening of periodontal ligament space is evident in some areas.

üì∏ Image 2 ‚Äì Working length or master cone trial:
Several endodontic files or gutta-percha cones are visible in the canals:

Suggests at least 3-4 canals were located and prepared (palatal, distobuccal, mesiobuccal, and possibly MB2 or second distal canal).

Files/cones are well-placed to working length, reaching near the apex without significant overextension.

A rubber dam clamp and isolation instruments are visible, indicating proper aseptic technique during treatment.

üì∏ Image 3 ‚Äì Additional angle or MB root focus:
Provides a clearer view of the MB root, which shows two distinct radiolucent paths ‚Äì confirming presence and instrumentation of MB1 and MB2 canals.

Good apical preparation and negotiation visible; no evident ledging or transportation.

Diagnosis:
Likely necrotic pulp with chronic apical periodontitis or symptomatic/asymptomatic apical abscess.

Tooth shows signs of complex root anatomy, with at least 4 canals, which is common in upper second molars.

Treatment Summary:
‚úÖ Steps Taken (as per radiographs):
Diagnosis and isolation with rubber dam.

Access cavity preparation and location of at least 4 canals.

Instrumentation and working length determination with files or cone fitting radiograph.

Good negotiation and shaping of curved roots, especially the MB root, which likely contained MB2.

Radiographic confirmation of full working length and canal path.

üß™ Suggested Next Steps:
Obturation with warm vertical compaction or lateral condensation of gutta-percha.

Final obturation X-ray to confirm fill quality.

Post-obturation coronal seal (temporary or permanent filling followed by crown depending on remaining tooth structure).

Periodic follow-up in 6‚Äì12 months to monitor periapical healing.

‚ö†Ô∏è Possible Challenges in This Case:
Anatomical complexity of upper second molars (curved or fused roots).

Locating and negotiating MB2.

Ensuring thorough disinfection of all canals to prevent reinfection.

Achieving a tight apical seal to promote periapical healing.
